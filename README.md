# Lab 4, jQuery and page interaction

In this lab we will work on interacting with a webpage. We will continue using eslint and writing tests.

Tests are a bit harder in this instance, as we want to also test things that happen in the web-page.

We will learn about a number of different technologies:

- Using NPM to describe our application and download helpful packages
- Using jQuery to manipulate our DOM
- Testing DOM interactions in the browser
- Using PhantomJS to test DOM interactions programmatically
